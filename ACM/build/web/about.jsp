                 <p style="color: whitesmoke">Since chatting with Pratik about what Gaming Geeks could be Nishita has been thinking about the long term plans for Gaming Geeks. As Sheâ€™s the most casual gamer of the group he makes up for it by working long hours on things beyond mere development or planning and in general caring too much about things like UX, optimizations and our code smell. Whatever that is... </p>
